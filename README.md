# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis (Beginner EDA Project)

## ✨ Project Overview

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the Titanic dataset. The goal is to identify which passenger features (like Sex, Pclass, and Age) were the most significant predictors of survival.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas:** For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
* **Seaborn & Matplotlib:** For statistical visualizations.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** To document the entire analysis workflow.

## 📊 Key Findings

The analysis revealed three dominant factors affecting survival:

1.  **Gender (Sex) Was Paramount:** Females had a significantly higher survival rate (approx. 74%) compared to males (approx. 19%), strongly indicating adherence to the "Women and Children First" protocol.
2.  **Socioeconomic Status (Pclass):** First-class passengers had the highest survival rate, while third-class passengers had the lowest, suggesting class privilege played a major role in rescue efforts.
3.  **Age Priority:** Young children (under 5) were often prioritized in rescue, showing a higher survival probability than most young adults.
